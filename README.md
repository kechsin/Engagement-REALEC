# Automated Determination of Engagement in the REALEC Based on the Appraisal Model by Martin and White (2005)
Engenia Lepikhina, HSE, Fundamental and Computational Linguistics

This repository is for my course paper in which I create a system which automatically determinates Engagement (Martin, White 2005) class of the sentence taken from REALEC's texts.

In the **engagement_analyzer** directory there is a python file models_classifier, that contains all model used in my work.

In the **annotated_text** directory there are texts, annotated on basis of their Engagement (Martin, White 2005) categories. 

All texts are from REALEC and are distributed and licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Texts are changed: separated into sentences and all punctuation marks at the end of sentences are deleted.

In the **annotator agreement** directory there are texts that were reannotated to measure annotator's agreement. Texts are also from REALEC under the same license with the same changes.
